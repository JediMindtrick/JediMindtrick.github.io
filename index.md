This Site
=========
The purpose of this site may change over time :=).  It is based off of a basic jekyll-bootstrap theme which I will modify over time.

This site is meant to be a central location for me to:

1. Show projects I have worked on
2. Gather notes and information I find useful
  * articles
  * videos
  * papers & books
3. Occasionally publish my own materials

I love to program, read and spend time with my wife and child.

I have been programming for a long time...I still remember programming the first computer my dad brought home, a Vic 20.

I am very proficient at javascript and C#.  I can also do some Clojure and some Scala.  I am good at application design and smaller system design (I just haven't had a chance at what I would consider a large system).  I love writing web apps.  I used to love the middle-tier, but have moved on from that.  I am still good in the middle tier.  I have a bevy of areas of interest in programming, which I will add later if I get around to it.  

I am not really good at the extremely visual part of programming web apps, which means I work best with a designer who is good with css and html.  Naturally, I'm somewhat proficient in these as well, but it's the last pixel-perfect-mile where I need a teammate to help me along.
